"""Level 1 conformance tests: signed EAT envelope with Ed25519 verification.

A Level 1 record must be a cmcp-runtime envelope carrying a valid Ed25519
signature by the key in trace.cnf.jwk over the canonical JSON body. The runner
module (TR-SIG) is the authoritative implementation; these tests drive it through
representative conformant and non-conformant fixtures to verify it behaves correctly.
